# Game Project : Side-scroller

_by Junior Elie MBAKOP_

## Here's the <a href="https://juniorelie.github.io/game-project-side-scroller/">DEMO</a> for my TLDR people <3

## What is it ?

This game was created as my first project during my bootcamp at Ironhack.

## What is the game about ?

This is an infinite side scroller where you control a character by jumping above obstacle coming towards him, with the level of difficulty being the obstacles coming faster after a set amount of time ! can you beat my record (1978) ?

## Why did I choose this one ?

The main inspiration for this game was Google's Dinosaur game and being a manga fan I decided to theme it around the popular manga serie: Naruto.
But instead of following the road to become the Hokage, here Naruto is aiming for a greater purpose... Becoming a fullstack web dev !! _Ninpo DOM Manipulation !_

## Features

- Naruto (The main selling point of course)
- Precision and anticipation difficulty
- Obstacles appearing in numbers randomly _Math.random()_
- Highscore setter so you can brag about it

## Issues

- Collision not very precise at times
- Intervals between obstacles not wide enough sometimes

## What's next ?

- Adding a choose your character screen
- Possibly different stages
- A variety of obstacles enemies
- A crouching animation
- Responsive Design ?
